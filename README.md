# Deep_Learning_via_C_plus_plus

# You can download this repository as a visual studio 2017 solution
# This solution includes two projects:
# neurons as a static library including some basic neuron concepts
# deeplearning as an executable program that can be trained
#
# I am now arranging makefile files for compilations on Linux, so the linux version may come soon.
